## Overview
This Movie Recommender System is a Python-based project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes movie metadata to recommend films that align with user interests.

## Features
1. Content-Based Filtering: Utilizes movie metadata, such as genres and descriptions, to recommend similar movies.
2. NLP-Powered: Processes movie descriptions using NLP techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy.
3. Efficient Computation: Handles large movie datasets with optimized data processing techniques.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical operations
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms
NLTK: For natural language processing 
AST: For parsing and evaluating expressions

## Future Enhancements
1. Collaborative Filtering: Add a collaborative filtering approach to combine with content-based filtering.
2. Improved UI: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
3. Real-time Recommendations: Implement real-time recommendation capabilities for dynamic user interactions.
